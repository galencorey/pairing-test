Take a look at `Mockup.htm` in Chrome. We want to rebuild the video thumbnail widget in React. We want to be able:
- Show type, video id, date underneath the video
- Reflect the Unreviewed/Valid/Invalid state of the video as a blank, green or red border
- change the state by interacting with the dropdown menu.

For this project, we're less concerned with matching the design exaxtly. We're interested in how you approach a new task, the questions you ask and how you iterate through problems that you encounter.
