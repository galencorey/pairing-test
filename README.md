## SC interview pairing project
For this project, we're not concerned with matching the design. We're interested in how you approach a new task, the questions you ask, and how you iterate through problems that you encounter.

### Design sample
Take a look at `Mockup.htm` in Chrome. The goal is to rebuild the video thumbnail widget in React. 

Your prototype should:
- Show type, video id, date underneath the video
- Reflect the Unreviewed/Valid/Invalid state of the video as a blank, green or red border
- change the state by interacting with the dropdown menu.
