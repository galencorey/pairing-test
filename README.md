## SC interview pairing project
For this project, we're not concerned with matching the design. We're interested in how you approach a new task, the questions you ask, and how you iterate through problems that you encounter.

### Instructions 
Youd goal is to build a video thumbnail widget in React. Your prototype should:

- Render a list of videos.
- Show type, video id, date underneath the video.
- Each video should have one of three `status`es: `unreviewed`, `valid`, or `invalid` 
- All videos should start out with a `status` of `unreviewed`.
- The user should be able to mark the videos as `valid` or `invalid` by interacting with the dropdown menu.
- The status of the video should be reflected by the video's border. A `valid` video should have a green border, an `invalid` video should have a red border, and an `unreviewed` video should have no border. 

### Design sample
Take a look at `Mockup.htm` in Chrome. 

### Running the project
You can start the project by running `npm install` and `npm start`. 

### Happy Coding!
